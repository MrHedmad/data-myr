# Data Myr
> The myr are like rusted metal: gleaming purpose hidden by a thin disguise of debris.

A data myr is a simple way to locally manage data following [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

## The idea

A myr **data bundle** is a folder with data and metadata inside.
It is in principle similar to [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/), but a lot simpler, so you can use it for your data *right now*.

It allows everyone to have their own metadata system, catered to their own need, while avoiding the need to learn a complex specification.

Ideally, everyone should follow a single, standardized metadata format, but it will take some time before such a format emerges and the community adopts it.
In the meantime, a lot of data is being produced, and a lot of it is wasted by not being even remotely FAIR.

You can use Myr to define a structure, perhaps for just your own lab, and uses it to manage your data.
Then, once (and if) a global standard is defined, you can migrate your data to that standard (in some way).

## The plan
Emoji key: ðŸ“…: Planned, ðŸš§: In progress, âœ…: Done
- ðŸš§ Define a simple, self-contained metadata format.
- ðŸ“… Implement a metadata validator for the format.
- ðŸ“… Start using the format in our own work.
- ðŸ“… Work out the kinks.

## The execution
- You can find examples of data myr in [examples/](examples/), so you can see if it's good for your use case.
- You can read about the format specification in [spec/README.md](spec/README.md).
- Read the formal specification [here](spec/specification.md).
